Based on this lab, why is using branches a powerful and safe way for a team of
software engineers to collaborate on a single project? What problems might it
prevent?

Using branches is a powerful and safe way for a software team to collaborate because each developer can work on features, 
bug fixes, or tests independently without affecting the main codebase. 
This keeps the main branch stable while changes are developed, tested, and reviewed before being merged.
Branching helps prevent problems such as overwriting teammates’ work, accidentally pushing broken 
or unfinished code, and creating large merge conflicts. 
By isolating changes and using pull requests, teams can catch bugs early, improve code quality, and collaborate more efficiently.
