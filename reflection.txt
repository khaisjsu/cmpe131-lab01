Based on this lab, why is using branches a powerful and safe way for a team of
software engineers to collaborate on a single project? What problems might it
prevent?

Using branches is a powerful and safe collaboration method because it lets each developer work on features, bug fixes, or testing in isolation without affecting the main, stable codebase. 
This separation allows teammates to test ideas, make mistakes, and iterate freely while the main branch remains deployable and reliable. 
Branches also make it easier to review changes through pull requests, catch bugs early, and discuss improvements before merging. 
By avoiding everyone committing directly to the same code at once, branching prevents problems like overwriting teammates’ work, introducing broken or untested code into production, and creating hard-to-resolve merge conflicts that slow down the team.
